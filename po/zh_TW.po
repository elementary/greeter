#. Ideally this would query PAM and ask which module is currently active,
#. but since we're running through LightDM we don't have that ability.
#. There should at be a state machine to transition to and from the
#. active module depending on the messages recieved. But, this is can go
#. wrong quickly.
#. The reason why this is needed is, for example, we can get the "An
#. unknown error occured" message from pam_fprintd, but we can get it
#. from some other random module as well. You never know.
#. Maybe it's worth adding some LightDM/PAM functionality for this?
#. The PAM "feature" which makes it all tricky is that modules can send
#. arbitrary messages to the stream and it's hard to analyze or keep track
#. of them programmatically.
#. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to give the user a choice over
#. which module he wants to use to authenticate (ie. maybe today I have
#. a bandaid over my finger and I can't scan it so I have to wait for it
#. time out, if I didn't disable that in the settings)
